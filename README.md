Multiple GPS receiver parser with position and speed filter

The original idea was to create a cheap 100Hz GPS receiver using commodity hardware by multiplexing multiple 10Hz USB GPS receivers.
In the proccess many problems arised, that are yet to be resolved.

Such receivers are useful in motorsports and aviation where great sampling rate and precision is required. 
The total cost of the hardware should be no more than $100USD
